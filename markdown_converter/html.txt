<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually <em>run out of snacks</em>.</p>
<p>To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the <em>top three</em> Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.</p>
<p>In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with <code>24000</code> Calories), then the third Elf (with <code>11000</code> Calories), then the fifth Elf (with <code>10000</code> Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is <code><em>45000</em></code>.</p>
<p>Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. <em>How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?</em></p>
